# (Don't Fear) The Reaper. A SIG as long term software maintenance network?

Dear Colleagues,

Since about 50 years archaeologists are applying computational methods to answer archaeological questions. A significant portion of the many thousands of resulting papers relied on interpreted languages for the implementation of relevant algorithms. Unfortunately most of that software was never published or shared in a reproducible way.

I suggest the Special Interest Group (SIG) for Scripting Languages in Archaeology (SSLA) to become a vehicle for software sharing and long term maintenance. It should provide a community and organisational framework for joint work and responsibility to create new and to prevent further loss of already established methodological knowledge.

There are already organisations which try to provide this service in a research subject agnostic way, namely the rOpenSci community. rOpenSci members develop research software in R, provide code review for their colleagues, promote releases and use cases and pick up relevant projects that are in danger of getting lost due to -- among other things -- changes in employment situations, illness or death.

I admire that project, but I also belive that it has two main weaknesses: Its limitation to R and its interdisciplinarity. Neither is inherently bad, but for the special applications of archaeology and cultural anthropology a thematically more focused and technically more open community might be a better setup. The SIG SSLA could fill that gap.

How exactly could that work?
